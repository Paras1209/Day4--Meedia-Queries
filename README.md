# Responsive Design with Media Queries

This project demonstrates responsive web design using CSS media queries. The website adapts to different screen sizes and provides an optimal viewing experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Fixed Width Elements Resolution ✅
- All elements use flexible layouts (flexbox, grid)
- Container max-widths prevent content from becoming too wide
- Images are responsive with `max-width: 100%` and `height: auto`

### 2. Media Query Targeting max-width 768px ✅
The CSS includes comprehensive media queries:
- `@media screen and (max-width: 768px)` - Tablet and below
- `@media screen and (max-width: 480px)` - Mobile phones
- `@media screen and (max-width: 320px)` - Extra small screens

### 3. Layout Adjustments ✅
**Desktop Layout:**
- Hero section: side-by-side content and image
- Features: 3-column grid
- Content: 2-column layout
- Gallery: multi-column grid

**Mobile Layout (≤768px):**
- Hero section: stacked vertically
- Features: single column
- Content: stacked vertically
- Gallery: responsive grid (1-2 columns)
- Reduced font sizes for better readability

### 4. Navigation Menu Responsive Design ✅
**Desktop:** Horizontal navigation bar
**Mobile:** 
- Hamburger menu icon
- Collapsible side menu
- Touch-friendly menu items
- Menu closes when clicking outside or on links

### 5. Chrome DevTools Testing ✅
Ready for testing with device toolbar simulation

### 6. Overflow and Scrolling Fixes ✅
- `overflow-x: hidden` on html and body
- All containers respect viewport width
- Images constrained within containers
- Flexbox items use `min-width: 0` to prevent overflow

### 7. Image Scaling ✅
- All images use `max-width: 100%` and `height: auto`
- `object-fit: cover` maintains aspect ratios
- Responsive image sizing based on container
- Placeholder images from Picsum for testing

## Responsive Breakpoints Used

| Breakpoint | Target Devices | Key Changes |

| ≤768px | Tablet, Large Mobile | Hamburger menu, stacked sections |
| ≤480px | Mobile Phones | Reduced fonts, single columns |
| ≤320px | Small Mobile | Extra compact layout |

## CSS Techniques Used

1. **Flexbox**: For flexible layouts that adapt to content
2. **CSS Grid**: For responsive grid systems
3. **Media Queries**: Screen-size specific styling
4. **Relative Units**: `rem`, `em`, `%`, `vw`, `vh` for scalability
5. **Box-sizing**: `border-box` for predictable sizing
6. **Object-fit**: For responsive image handling
7. **Viewport Meta Tag**: For proper mobile rendering
